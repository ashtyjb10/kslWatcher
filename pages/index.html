      <p>Welcome to the KSLWatcher!</p>
        <p>This service will keep an eye on the KSL Classifieds for you and alert
        you when a new listing of interest appears.Using this system means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            More free time -- no longer do you need to visit KSL regularly to
            check for that unopened BeeGees vinyl record you've been pining after.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fewer lost opportunities -- don't lose out to someone who's spending
            all their time scanning the KSL site while you do real work in the
            real world.
          </li>
